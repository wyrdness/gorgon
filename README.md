## Overview

The Gorgons are three monstrous sisters from Greek mythology—**Medusa**, **Stheno**, and **Euryale**—daughters of the primordial sea deities Phorcys and Ceto. Described as having snake hair, brass hands, golden wings, tusks, and a horrifying appearance, they possessed the terrifying power to turn anyone who gazed upon them to stone.

While Stheno and Euryale were immortal, Medusa was mortal and was ultimately killed by the hero Perseus. The Gorgons lived at the edge of the world, beyond the Ocean, in a realm associated with Night.

In ancient Greek culture, the gorgoneion (a protective image of a Gorgon's head) was widely used as an apotropaic symbol to ward off evil, decorating temples, shields, and household items throughout the ancient Mediterranean world.

## The Perseus Myth

### The Quest
Perseus was tasked by King Polydectes to bring back Medusa's head—an impossible task meant to result in his death.

### Divine Aid
- **Athena**: Provided a polished bronze shield to view Medusa's reflection
- **Hermes**: Gave winged sandals and a sword
- **Hades**: Provided helm of invisibility
- **Graeae**: Forced to reveal the Gorgons' location

### The Slaying
Perseus approached Medusa while she slept, viewing her only through the reflection in his shield. He beheaded her with a single stroke. From her neck sprang Pegasus (the winged horse) and Chrysaor (a golden giant).

### The Pursuit
Stheno and Euryale awoke and pursued Perseus, but he escaped using Hades' helm of invisibility.

### Medusa's Head
Perseus used the severed head as a weapon, turning enemies to stone. He eventually gave it to Athena, who placed it on her aegis (shield/breastplate).
