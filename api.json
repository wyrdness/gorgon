      "full": "The Gorgons are three monstrous sisters from Greek mythology—**Medusa**, **Stheno**, and **Euryale**—daughters of the primordial sea deities Phorcys and Ceto. Described as having snake hair, brass hands, golden wings, tusks, and a horrifying appearance, they possessed the terrifying power to turn anyone who gazed upon them to stone. While Stheno and Euryale were immortal, Medusa was mortal and was ultimately killed by the hero Perseus. The Gorgons lived at the edge of the world, beyond the Ocean, in a realm associated with Night. In ancient Greek culture, the gorgoneion (a protective image of a Gorgon's head) was widely used as an apotropaic symbol to ward off evil, decorating temples, shields, and household items throughout the ancient Mediterranean world."
